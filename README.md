# Facility Location Problem
The B.Tech Project Report done in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Technology at IITG (2019-23)
We explored a few meta-heuristic techniques: Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), etc. 
We used these meta-heuristic techniques as the solution tool by making some variations to these algorithms for solving
the problem by defining the objective function and using the penalty approach for the constraints on MATLAB. Although computationally costly, a Mixed Integer Linear Program-
ming (MILP) approach was also used to obtain optimal solutions by simulating on Pythonâ€™s
pulp library (CBC MILP Solver) so as to compare results with the other techniques.
